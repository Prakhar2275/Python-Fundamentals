# 🐍 Python Fundamentals


## 📘 Overview
This repository — **Python Fundamentals** — is a collection of **beginner-to-intermediate real-world Python projects** built to strengthen core programming concepts and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Each project focuses on solving **practical problems** using clean, modular, and well-documented Python code.  
It’s designed to help learners and job seekers **build a strong Python foundation** while creating portfolio-worthy projects.
